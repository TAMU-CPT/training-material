> ### {% icon question %} One of my datasets turned red, what do I do?
>    > ### {% icon solution %} Solution
>    > * Expand the dataset by clicking on the name. Click on the bug icon ![](../../images/galaxy-faq-screenshots/1_report_bug.png), and read the message that appears - it may give you a clue. [CPT IT staff](http://cpt.tamu.edu) will respond as soon as possible. **Do not rerun the job** unless you are changing some parameter to attempt to fix the problem. Otherwise, the history will be clogged with unnecessary, stalled jobs.
>    > * Examples of common errors include:
>    >    > * *User did not enter common name* - this is where you need to choose the phage name from the drop-down box, or type in a new name for your new organism (unique to Apollo).
>    >    > * *Wrong input* - triple check the file that the tool requires as input. If you have the wrong file type, search the list of tools for a converter.
>    >    > * *Wrong tool used* - read the blurb below each tool to make sure it does what you think it should.
