# Genome Visualization

Tools located in [Galaxy](https://cpt.tamu.edu/galaxy-pub) under **CPT: Genomic Viz**.
### GenBank Feature Array Plot
> * [Link to tool](https://cpt.tamu.edu/galaxy-pub/root?tool_id=edu.tamu.cpt.genbank.DavidsonPlot)
> * Description: 
>    > * Creates a Davidson Plot
>    > * Each gene is printed as a small coloured box in order to help identify regions of shared functionality (even if they do not share dna/protein homology)
> * Example Graphic:

> * Relevant Options:
>    > * size of box can be edited (default is 10)
>
### Genome Mapper
> * [Link to tool](https://cpt.tamu.edu/galaxy-pub/root?tool_id=edu.tamu.cpt2.phage.genome_map)
> * Description: 
>    > * Produces publication quality genome maps
> * Example Graphic:

> * Relevant Options:
>    > * Width (Leave on default of 0 to have to the tool choose an acceptable width for you.)
>    > * Desired # of Rows
>    > * Whether to show label for hypothetical novel/conserved genes
>    > * Whether to plot a portion of the genome
