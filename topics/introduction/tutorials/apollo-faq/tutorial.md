# Apollo FAQ

> ### {% icon question %} My gene names/edits won’t save!

> ### {% icon question %} I can not delete a gene
>    > ### {% icon solution %} Solution
>    > * You need to *double click* on the gene to select the gene and the Shine-Dalgarno feature, and then right click to select delete.

> ### {% icon question %} I cannot drag the boundaries of a gene that has a Shine-Dalgarno sequence.
>    > ### {% icon solution %} Solution
>    > * Currently the bundaries for genes without Shine-Dalgarno sequences can be modified by directly dragging, but not for genes with Shine-Dalgarno sequences. This is a known issue that we are trying to fix.  Currently we suggest such modification to be carried out in external annotation tools such as Sanger Artemis.

> ### {% icon question %} Upon logging in to Apollo, the following error message appears.
>    > ![](../../images/apollo-faq-screenshots/1-no-sequence-error.png)
>    >
>    > ### {% icon solution %} Solution
>    > * This error message occurs because a FASTA file with a name that did not match the organism in question was applied in a JBrowse job in Galaxy and applied to the organism in Apollo. You can see this in the following images as a mismatch between the names in the Apollo window (ID fields should match).

>    > **Suggested Action:**
>    > * Generate a fresh JBrowse instance to apply to Apollo. **Caution: this will erase your evidence tracks, but not the annotations in the user-created annotations track.** Do this by running the [JBrowse tool](https://cpt.tamu.edu/galaxy/root?tool_id=jbrowse-iuc-cpt), selecting NEW JBrowse instance and pointing it to a fasta sequence with the correct name to match the sequence ID of your Apollo organism (use the [rename tool](https://cpt.tamu.edu/galaxy/root?tool_id=edu.tamu.cpt.seq.rename) if needed, but better to use a fasta generated after [retrieving Data](https://cpt.tamu.edu/galaxy/root?tool_id=export) from Apollo). Finally, run the Create or [Update Organism tool](https://cpt.tamu.edu/galaxy/root?tool_id=create_or_update) and apply the new JBrowse dataset.
